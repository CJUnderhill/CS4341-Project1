### In this project we implemented 9 different graph search methods

### Specifically, the output trace you will see includes the order of node expansion of the graph along with the queue of alternate paths for each of the following search methods:

1. Depth First Search 

2. Breadth First Search 

3. Depth Limited Search (using limit = 2) 

4. Iterative Deepening Search 
5.Uniform Cost Search ( or Branch and Bound) 

6. Greedy Search (or Best First Search) 

7. A-star 

8. Hill Climbing (no backtracking) 

9. Beam Search (using width = 2)



## _How to run_

### Run Main.py, which will ask you to input a file name containing a graph in the specified format, and you will be able to see the ouput trace of each of the search methods on that graph.
