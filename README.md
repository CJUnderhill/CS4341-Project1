# CS4341-Project1
### In this project we implemented 9 different graph search methods
### Specifically, the output trace you will see includes the order of node expansion of the graph along with the queue of alternate paths for each of the following search methods:
1. Depth First Search 
2. Breadth First Search 3.
3. Depth Limited Search (using limit = 2) 
4. Iterative Deepening Search 
5. 5.Uniform Cost Search ( or Branch and Bound) 
6. Greedy Search (or Best First Search) 
7. A-star 
8. Hill Climbing (no backtracking) 
9. Beam Search (using width = 2)

## _How to run_
### Input the path of the txt file that has the graph in the specified format, after you run Main.py and you will see the output trace of each of the search methods.
